# collatz

This is a math project testing out a math problem called the Collatz conjecture. It states that two functions can be applied to each number and they are theorized to eventually reach one, though this has not been proven. It is:

If a term is even, divide by 2 to reach the next term.
If a term is odd, multiply by three to reach the next term.

But there is a lot more to this math problem than meets the eye. Mathematicians have been unable to solve the problem of whether or not we always reach one. This program seeks to do something far more interesting with the Collatz conjecture. See which numbers have the biggest numbers of down-reaches to get to 1.
